# Introduction
This is an offsite backup solution based on rsync and launchd. It's pretty easy to use and
set up.

# Files       
- start_offsite.sh the main script that does the actual backup and notification
- stop_offsite.sh the script to stop the backup in case it exceeds a time limit
- offsite_include.sh paths to files and directories to back up

# Installation
- Make sure both the client and the server are running the same version of rsync.
The Mac ToolKit (http://github.com/filipp/mtk) has a script to build the latest
rsync with all the Mac-specific patches
- Install rsync to /usr/local/bin/
- Make sure your firewall permits traffic on 873 TCP/UDP
- Create rsyncd.conf on the server and configure to your liking
- Start rsync in daemon mode on the server    
- Edit start_offsite.sh to match your environment
- Add stuff to backup into offsite_include.txt
- Create two launchd jobs, one to run start_offsite.sh and the other to stop_offsite.sh, you can
name them whatever you like
- Load the new launchd plists

# Operation

start_offsite.sh spawns off rsync with all the apropriate switches (including --delete!)
You can monitor the progress of the backup by tailing offsite.log
The system will send some stats to the specified email address once the process is complete

# launchd plists
You need two of these, one to start, something like:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>offsync.start</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
                <string>/Library/offsync/start.sh</string>
        </array>
        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
        <dict>
                <key>Hour</key>
                <integer>23</integer>
                <key>Minute</key>
                <integer>0</integer>
        </dict>
        <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>
        <true/>
</dict>
</plist>

and the second one to stop:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>offsync.stop</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
                <string>/Library/offsync/start.sh</string>
        </array>
        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
        <dict>
                <key>Hour</key>
                <integer>7</integer>
                <key>Minute</key>
                <integer>0</integer>
        </dict>
        <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>
        <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
